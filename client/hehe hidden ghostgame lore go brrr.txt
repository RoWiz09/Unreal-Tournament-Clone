Samuel’s final log - CONFIDENTIAL
This is it… Alex, I’m sorry…
I thought it might have been possible to survive it, but it injured me. It’s watching me. Listen, you need to go to Blackwood Hollow Manor. This ghost originated from there, and it is trying to keep something hidden from us. I can’t help you much, but I’ll provide the rest of the information you need to know before going to Blackwood Hollow.

Blackwood Hollow Manor used to be owned by our ghost hunting corporation's owner back before we were even alive. It was built by him in 1973, and about eight years later he was found running from it. That was when he started the ghost hunting corporation. Sixty years later, studies they conducted showed that it was built where the gap between the spectral world and ours was extremely thin. That is why I was being sent in.

Please, Alex. Forgive me, but I need you to solve this mystery. That’s what you do best, and that’s why I chose you to continue my mission. However, don’t expect it to be easy. You weren’t trained for ghost hunting like I was.
